This is a short overview of what fields should be in the JSON Format
First, the name - I will make sure that this name is unique so that way you can treat it like a keyword
Second and third, height and width, these will both be floats
Fourth, a center, this is a coordinate pair of two floats
Fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth will be coordinate pairs of the top right, top left, bottom right, bottom left, respectively
Those will be stored as coordinate pairs of floats also
Finally, color, this will be stored as coordinates of three with each value from 0-1
These will be in RGB format

Every JSON object will consist of an array of these objects, nothing more
(I might add more information about weather, lighting, global variables, as necessary)
